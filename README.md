## Day 1

### Session 1: Building Recommendation Engine using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
**Key take-aways :** Understand pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow etc. - Refer to Kiran's Juyptr notebook

### Session 2: Future of Data in Digital Enterprise - Ronald van Loon
**Key take-aways :** Explore industries where ML/AL can be implemented. Amazing opportunities are lying ahead in manufauring, medicine, oil & gas etc.

### Session 3: Bridging the gap between ML and Business Decision making - Karthikeyan Sankaran
**Key take-aways :** Explore Simulation Modelling which will make models more interpretable

### Session 4: Using ML to solve the product quality of E-commerce - Sumit Gupta
**Key take- aways :** Automating the whole Modelling building process where at one go 1000 models are built to generate outputs across Categories.

### Session 5: What makes more money - A/B Testing or Multi-Armed Bandit? - Ankit Choudhary (AV)
**Key take-aways :** Explore the applications fo Multi-Armed Bandit for business.<br />
Also, how to use Movie Lens dataset to create a online simulation wherein customers can be used as Visitor who watched a particular show and then use it to test recommendation code.

### Session 6: Identify Location using Clustering and Text Analytics - Divya Choudary
**Key take-aways :** One of the Hack-sessions. The cab-aggregators have a feature in their apps where for any public area, the common pick-up points are highlighted by the app.<br />
Using K-means Clustering to identify the suitable clusters around any public area and then using Text mining to  label the clusters for each of the Public area. It had interesting way of using n-gram and ordering to pick out the labels.

### Session 7: Graph Embedding - Social Network Analysis through Deep Learning Lens
**Key take-aways :** Read what is Graph Embedding and explore deep learning

## Day 2

### Session 1: Building Intelligent Chatbots - Amitoj Singh & Rishi Shah (pwc)
**Key take-aways :** What are the types of chatbots.<br />
How parts of the bot to keep in mind while building one and how to integrate with any system

### Session 2: Auomated Code generation using Design requirements
**Key take-aways :** There are companies who are automating the back-ending code generation from wire-frames drawn on paper and you get front-end ready. It will revolutionalize the whole coding space it terms of requirements of developers.

### Session 3: Climbing the Pyramid of ML->DL->AI  - by Tarry Singh
**Key take-aways :** There are 5 levels of learning Pyramid. Understand in each of these level what is your level of expertise.<br />
Explore other industries where human problems can be solved using DL/AI.

### Session 4: Automating the Machine Learning Pipeline using AutoML - Sunil Kumar Chinnamgari
**Key take-aways :** Explore Auto-ML libraries in R & Python. Got introduced to TPOT (amazing thing in autoML space).<br />
Also, why AutoML is not an enemy and how to use it as a aid so that Data Scientist can better utilize his/her time instead of hyper-parameter tunning, feature selection etc.

### H2O.ai booth : Data Scientist in a box
**Key take-aways :** H2O.ai has built a product which can automate the whole ML space. It is basically a paid verison of TPOT.
In future, you will not require 3 Data Scientist to build 3 models - 1 Data Scientist can do the job. Its called H2O Driveless AI. It has 21 days Free Trail do try it out. It is going to be the future Tableau in ML Space.
