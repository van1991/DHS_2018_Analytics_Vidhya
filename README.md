### Session 6: Identify Location using Clustering and Text Analytics - Diya Choudary
**Key take-aways :** One of the Hack-sessions. The cab-aggregators have a feature in their apps where for any public area, the common pick-up points are highlighted by the app.<br />
Using K-means Clustering to identify the suitable clusters around any public area and then using Text mining to  label the clusters for each of the Public area. It had interesting way of using n-gram and ordering to pick out the labels.

### Session 7: Graph Embedding - Social Network Analysis through Deep Learning Lens
**Key take-aways :** Read what is Graph Embedding and explore deep learning
